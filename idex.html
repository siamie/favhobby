        <h3>Anime</h3>
         <img src="shonen.jpg" class="profile" />
        <p>There are many other anime that are very enjoyable and the animation and the song and the manga and the type of anime and many others is the reason why I can't get out of it, there's also anime book that is called manga which comes before the anime and is the original since it comes first but if not the anime is the original. There are also anime not based from the manga or where there is no manga and reverse as well, that means there are also manga that have no anime adaptions. I also sometimes read the manga because i can't wait to see what happen next. i especially like it when the characters are good and the story as well, but more of the charater.</p>

            <h3>Drawing</h3>
            <p>I like drawing because it's just fun I don't know how to explain why. i like to draw like the anime art styles but i also like it in other art style which doesn't look too realistic because i love illustration art and calm art. Also I like 90's anime art style because of the aesthetic and 80's as well. it's also the reason why i read mangas.Although i dpn't have many colors and pencil that are use by many artist but i still like drawing very much so that's not the reason i should give up. I love drawing even though i'm not so good at it.</p>
